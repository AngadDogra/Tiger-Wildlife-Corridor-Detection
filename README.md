# Tiger-Wildlife-Corridor-Detection

## Project Overview
This project leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze and identify optimal locations for deploying anti-poaching devices in poaching hotspots across India. Using latitude and longitude data from a shapefile, we visualize poaching trends and provide actionable insights for wildlife conservation.

## Objectives
- Utilize K-Means clustering to analyze poaching hotspot data.
- Identify strategic locations for anti-poaching device placement.
- Visualize results on a map of India generated using geographic data.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Clean and format input data for analysis.
- **Clustering Algorithm**: Implement K-Means to group data points by geographic location.
- **Visualization**: Generate maps that display clusters and recommended placement areas.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Provide visual outputs to guide conservation strategies.
